A C++ library enriching the knowledge and awaking the  interest on data
structures and algorithms. Data structures and algorithms are important and 
the basics, at most, should be known. 

## Implementation Philosophy
The focus of each implementation steps start as follow: first, we study the 
concept of the data structure or algorithm, second we design and document a 
clear and simple API, third we implement, and forth we analyze and refactor 
the implementation. There most be a robust unit-test suite for each data 
structure or algorithm that prove the reliability of the above. 

## Current Implementations

- AVL Tree (progress)
- Binary Search Tree
    - Binary Tree Node
- Dynamic Array
- Deque
- Insertion Sort
- Linked List
    - Singly Linked List
    - Doubly Linked List (progress)
- Queue
- Stack

## Will Implement

- Hash Table
- Hash Function
- Red Black Tree
- B-Tree
- Skip List
- Merge Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Shell Sort
- Ring Buffer
- Heap Sort
- Heap
- Graph
- Breadth-first Search
- Depth-first Search

## Contributions
Everyone is welcome to contribute! Pick any of the "Will Implement" items 
displayed above, move it to the "Current Implementation" and make a pull 
request. We also suggest to follow the same naming convention of the current 
implementations, for example the Linked List, and also read the 
"Implementation Philosophy" displayed above.
